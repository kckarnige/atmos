<h2> Atmosphère is a work-in-progress customized firmware for the Nintendo Switch. </h2> </head>
<h2>Components</h2></p>

Atmosphère consists of multiple components, each of which replaces/modifies a different component of the system:</p>

    Fusée: First-stage Loader, responsible for loading and validating stage 2 (custom TrustZone) plus package2 (Kernel/FIRM sysmodules), and patching them as needed. This replaces all functionality normally in Package1loader/NX Bootloader.</p>
        Sept: Payload used to enable support for runtime key derivation on 7.0.0.</p>
    Exosphère: Customized TrustZone, to run a customized Secure Monitor</p>
    Thermosphère: EL2 EmuNAND support, i.e. backing up and using virtualized/redirected NAND images</p>
    Stratosphère: Custom Sysmodule(s), both Rosalina style to extend the kernel/provide new features, and of the loader reimplementation style to hook important system actions</p>
    Troposphère: Application-level Horizon OS patches, used to implement desirable CFW features</p>
