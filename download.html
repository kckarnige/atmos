Lastest stable release 1.0.0 </p>

1.0.0 is Atmosphère's fifty-fourth official release.<br>

Please be sure to update fusee when upgrading to 1.0.0. fusee-primary no longer exists, and will not work any more.<br>

With thanks to the @switchbrew team, Atmosphère 1.0.0 is bundled with hbl 2.4.1, and hbmenu 3.4.1.<br>

The following was changed since the last release:<br>

    fusee was completely re-written in C++ to use the same atmosphere-libs APIs as the rest of atmosphere's code.<br>
        The rewrite was performed with a big emphasis on ensuring a good boot speed, and generally boot should be much faster than it was previously.<br>
            Depending on SD card/environment, boot speed may now be slightly faster than, roughly the same as, or slightly slower than when booting with hekate.<br>
            The obvious low-hanging fruit for performance improvements has been picked, so hopefully the improved performance is to everybody's liking.<br>
        SD card compatibility was improved: fusee should now have SD card compatibility identical to the official OS driver.<br>
        Please Note: various components were renamed (fusee-primary.bin -> fusee.bin, fusee-secondary.bin -> package3).<br>
            If you use another bootloader (like hekate), you may need to update your configuration to use the new layout.<br>
        Please Note: BCT.ini no longer exists, nogc configuration has been moved to /atmosphere/config/stratosphere.ini.<br>
            If you rely on custom nogc configuration, please be sure to update accordingly.<br>
        Custom splash screen BMP parsing is no longer supported (as it slows down boot for 99% of users).<br>
            To compensate for this, a script to insert a custom splash screen into a package3 binary has been added to the utilities folder of the atmosphere repository.<br>
            The release build should be equivalent to running the following command from the root of the atmosphere repository: python utilities/insert_splash_screen.py img/splash.png fusee/package3<br>
    A number of pending changes were made, following the end of the relevant testing periods:<br>
        mesosphere is no longer opt-out, and stratosphere code will begin depending on its being present/in use.<br>
        NCM is no longer opt-out.
        The cleanup to ease the transition from < 0.19.0 to 0.19.0 has been removed.<br>
    General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.<br>

For information on the featureset supported by 1.0, please see the official release notes.<br>
