Lastest stable release 1.1.0 </p>

  1.1.1 is Atmosphère's fifty-sixth official release.</p>

Please be sure to update fusee when upgrading to 1.1.1. fusee-primary no longer exists, and will not work any more.</p>

With thanks to the @switchbrew team, Atmosphère 1.1.1 is bundled with hbl 2.4.1, and hbmenu 3.4.1.</p>

The following was changed since the last release:</p>

    A bug was fixed which caused some memory to leak when launching a game with mods enabled, eventually causing a crash after enough game launches without rebooting.<br>
  General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</p>

  And the following was changed in 1.1.0:</p>

    Support was implemented for 13.0.0.<br>
        mesosphère was updated to reflect the latest official kernel behavior.<br>
        ncm was updated to reflect the latest official behaviors.<br>
        erpt was updated to reflect the latest official behaviors.<br>
            Two new services ("sprofile") were added to erpt, and have been fully reimplemented.<br>
            Please Note: These services provide a way for settings to be pushed to consoles over the internet without system update.<br>
                Because there appear to be no settings pushed out yet, this implementation fundamentally cannot be fully tested right now, but hopefully there are no issues once settings begin being distributed.<br>
    The LogManager system module was reimplemented.<br>
        This system module provides services that some games use for logging.<br>
        Atmosphere's reimplementation supports logging to the SD card (if lm!enable_sd_card_logging is true) and to ams.TMA.<br>
            To control the directory where logs are saved, modify the lm!sd_card_log_output_directory setting.<br>
        Atmosphere's reimplementation is disabled by default (in order to save memory), but can be enabled by setting lm!enable_log_manager to true.<br>
            This will allow reading over logs from games which use the services (or potentially logging from homebrew in the future), which can be useful to developers.<br>
            Please note that when TMA is fully implemented in the future, enabling TMA will forcibly enable LogManager.<br>
    General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</p>
