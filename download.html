Lastest stable release 0.19.5 </p>

<font color="white">
0.19.5 is Atmosphère's fifty-first official release. </p>

fusee-primary was last updated in: 0.19.3. </p>

With thanks to the @switchbrew team, Atmosphère 0.19.5 is bundled with hbl 2.4.1, and hbmenu 3.4.0.</p>

The following was changed since the last release:</p>

    Support was added for 12.1.0.</p>
    LayeredFS support was added for OpenDataStorageWithProgramIndex commands.</p>
        Certain games using newer (7.0.0+ APIs) which include multiple programs under a single title previously could not be modified.</p>
        These are now supported as normal, and LayeredFS should have 100% compatibility again.</p>
    A number of minor issues were fixed, including:</p>
        The Reboot to Payload NRO was updated to allow the OS to save state prior to rebooting (thanks @AuroraWright)!</p>
        An issue was fixed that could cause dns.mitm to fail when games requested resolution of an empty string.</p>
        An issue was fixed that caused a memory leak in the erpt system module.</p>
            This would eventually cause a system crash after ~540 reports were generated without rebooting.</p>
    A number of minor improvements were made to improve mesosphere's accuracyv.</p>
    General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</p>

For information on the featureset supported by 0.19, please see the official release notes.</p>
